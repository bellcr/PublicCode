Charles Bell, text based RPG
Created: May 4th, 2017

Rules:

The rules of the text based RPG are layed out within the system.

The user must choose a starting class for their character from the options: Human, Cyberdemon, Balrog, Elf, Dark Elf.
Each class has unique starting attributes and unique combat styles.

The user is then presented with 3 doors on every level, the user chooses a door by entering the number '1', '2', or '3'
into the system. If the user encounters a creature a battle simulation is run to see which creature wins the battle.

Within the battle system the user controlled character will always be the first listed health and the first listed
attack.

If the user finds an item its effect is immediately added to the user, if nothing is found the game continues. If the 
user survives the level the level of the game increases by 1.

Every five levels the game scales up in difficulty. This makes the enemies more powerful to face, as well as items
providing a bigger boost to the user stats.

The goal of the game is to reach as high of a level as possible, the game requires a little bit of luck
